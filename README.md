# My-Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio repository! Here, you'll find a collection of code samples that I wrote as part of my learning projects at university. These projects showcase my skills in programming and embedded systems development.



Projects:

Below are some of the key projects included in this repository:

8051 Hexadecimal Counter - A C program for the 8051 microcontroller that increments and decrements values in hexadecimal after pressing a binding

8051 PWM Controller - A C program for the 8051 microcontroller that increases or decreases the pulse width based on key presses.
